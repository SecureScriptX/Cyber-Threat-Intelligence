# Using Threat Intelligence

After the data is interpreted in relation to the attack surface, it will become consumable threat intelligence. The intelligence obtained can be used in the following 3 different areas.

- External Attack Surface Management (EASM)
- Digital Risk Protection (DRP)
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

When these 3 areas are combined, they form the XTI structure we mentioned at the beginning of our training. Each structure consumes intelligence by using it on different topics.

## External Attack Surface Management (EASM)

EASM is part of XTI, which manages organizations' outward assets. We explained how to create the attack surface, which is the basis of External Attack Surface Management, in the previous sections. In this section, we will cover how we manage the attack surface we have created and how it is fed from the collected intelligence.

Attack surface is essential for organizations to detect their unknown or forgotten assets and provide visibility. EASM comes into play since any security vulnerability on these assets will pose a risk for the organization. Detected assets must be monitored constantly. For example, adding a newly purchased domain to the asset list immediately or deleting a discontinued domain from the asset list is a part of this monitoring effort. We can keep track of these assets through External Attack Surface Management. EASM will notify the user if a domain expires, the title of the website changes, or a subdomain is created.

One of the main factors that will provide intelligence in this section is the use of information obtained from the assets themselves. A second factor is using the intelligence produced as a result of the vulnerability data obtained from outside sources like Shodan, etc. In this part, we receive notifications about security vulnerabilities on our assets as a result of the intelligence we used.

### Alarms and Actions:

## New Digital Asset(s) Detected:
  - This is the warning we will encounter when a new asset is detected and added to our continuously monitored asset list. We need to check whether the asset really belongs to our organization and was created by the authorized users of our organization.

## Domain Information Change Detected:
  - It is the warning that alerts us when there is any change in the "whois" information of the domain in our asset list. We should check this activity to see if it is a harmful activity or not by comparing the old and the new data and verifying if the change is made by the authorized users of our organization.

## DNS Information Change Detected:
  - This is the warning that alerts us when there is any change in the DNS records of the domain in our asset list. We should check this activity to see if it is a harmful activity or not by comparing the old and the new data and verifying if the change is made by the authorized users of our organization.

## DNS Zone Transfer Detected:
  - This is the warning that alerts us when there is a change in DNS Zone Transfer status of the domain in our asset list. We should check the DNS records for the relevant assets and verify if there is a zone transfer.

- **Internal IP Adress Detected:**
  - Since the IP addresses we specify in the A records of our domains are open to the public and can be seen outside of our network, they must not be internal IP addresses. If an internal IP is disclosed in the A record of a domain or subdomain, we will receive an alert that warns us of the “Internal IP Address Detected” on our EASM side. This may happen due to the lack of communication between different teams in our organization. In such cases, the process should be verified by contacting the POC of the DNS record maintenance and the root cause should be investigated. The IP should be changed if its use is not necessary.

## Critical Open Port Detected:
  - This is the warning that alerts us when there is an indication for open critical ports on the IPs that we are monitoring within the intelligence we received from sources such as “Shodan”. We should check the ports claimed to be open on the relevant IP addresses that we receive the alert, and we should close or filter them if they are not the ports used by our network actively. If the open ports are used actively, then we should update the services running on them and keep them up to date, and make sure that necessary configurations are complete.

## SMTP Open Relay Detected:
  - This is the warning that alerts us when there is an open relay status for our mail server which we monitor within our asset list. We should investigate the mail server in question and verify the status of the mail server by contacting the POC of the server.

## SPF/DMARC Record Not Found:
  - SPF and DMARC records are constantly checked for domains that we track in our asset list, and we receive this alert when these records are not found. These records must be configured correctly for the security of our mail servers. We need to contact the POC of our mail server and verify its status.

## SSL Certificate Revoked/Expired:
-SSL certificates are one of the most important elements for secure communication. Our SSL certificates hosted on our domains should be monitored regularly within our asset list. We will receive this alert if one of our SSL certificates is expired or revoked. Any communication carried out without SSL poses high risks as the data is transmitted in clear text and can be seen by third parties. Therefore, we need to renew our SSL certificate as soon as possible when we receive this alert. 

## Suspicious Website Redirection

Sometimes we redirect some of our domains to some of our websites. If we do this frequently, we are likely to miss suspicious redirects. Therefore, we need to receive feeds that provide us with the status codes of our websites and where they are directed. If we receive this alert, it means that one of our domains in our asset list is redirecting to a website that is not in our asset list. This indicates a potential breach. We must urgently check the redirection and report the case to the relevant team that manages these issues.

## Subdomain Takeover Detected

We receive this alert if a takeover is detected on a subdomain. This case should be investigated to find the DNS record that this takeover took place and the details should be shared with the team that will handle the case.

## Website Status Code Changed

We receive this alert when the status code that our website returns back to us is changed. This warning comes to us from the data containing the status codes of the websites. In order to prevent service interruptions, the status code and the problem should be determined with its root cause, and the solutions to remediate the issue should be applied immediately.

## Vulnerability Detected

This alert comes to us as a result of intelligence obtained from vulnerability data. If we encounter this warning, it means that there is a match between the vulnerabilities in the data and our network applications, SSL certificates, domains, websites, IPs, or 3rd party technologies. If the warning is generated from the CVE data and there is product and version information in which the vulnerability is triggered in the details of the CVE, the accuracy of the alert is very high, immediate action must be taken and the suggested fixes should be applied immediately. The accuracy rate may be slightly lower if the warning is coming from other sources like Shodan, etc.

## Digital Risk Protection

DRP is the part of XTI that constitutes most of the intelligence for the organization after all the data collected from all the sources are mapped with the attack surface following the interpretation of the data. In this section, we will cover topics such as the protection of brand reputation, threats on the Deep&Dark Web, fraud protection specific to banks, the impact of risks that may occur in any organization in the supply chain, threats to the organization on the web surface and protection for senior executives, and the threats and risks we may face related to these as well as how we should take action against them will be detailed. Below are the alarms that we may encounter within the scope of DRP and the actions we can take:

### Potential Phishing Domain Detected

Newly registered domains or previously registered domains with newly created SSL certificates are an intelligence source for us. After interpreting the data obtained from these sources, we encounter this warning for domains with a structure similar to our domains in the intelligence obtained. When we receive this alert, we should investigate the relevant domain in safe environments and determine whether they are mimicking our original content. If these domains mimic our brand and/or content, we should contact the domain registrar and the ISP that hosts the content of the fraudulent site to take it down immediately. If there is nothing suspicious in the content, the domain should still be monitored there is a high potential for that domain to turn into a phishing site.

### Rogue Mobile Application Detected

If our organization has mobile applications, we will receive this alert if there is a match with our official mobile application and the data that contains the pirated APK files found on pirated APK sites with similar names and similar content. The APK files transmitted in this alert should be analyzed in a safe environment, and quick remediation action should be taken if they are found malicious. These copycat mobile applications should be taken down immediately to avoid any malicious activities and to protect our brand reputation.

### IP Address Reputation

There are multiple reasons that cause the loss of reputation of IP addresses. If we receive this alert it means that there is an incident that occurred affecting our IP reputation. Possible reasons for the loss of the IP reputation are as follows:

- If the IP address is blacklisted on any source for any reason,
- If the IP address is found in a feed containing harmful IOCs,
- If the IP address has been involved in an activity in the torrent network, then the reputation of the IP address will be lost.

We will receive this alert if any of our IP addresses are among the resources that will cause this reputation loss. If it is a blacklist case, we should investigate the root cause and determine on what sources it has been blacklisted. The root cause of the blacklist should be investigated and eliminated. It will be more risky and harmful if our IP addresses have been found in a feed containing harmful IOCs or involved in the torrent network because our IP addresses could potentially be used in a malicious campaign. This raises the possibility that the organization has been breached. In this case, we must quickly investigate the relevant systems retrospectively and identify the root cause. If the breach has happened, we need to enforce the internal policies.

### Impersonating Social Media Account Detected

Social media is a platform that many organizations use to represent themselves. Thousands of new accounts are created every day on these platforms. Not all accounts are created with good intentions. Many accounts may be created with user names that can imitate the original accounts of the organization or with the intention to conduct smear campaigns against the organization. We will receive this alert if we encounter such a situation. In this case, the relevant account should be reviewed and determined whether it is just a name similarity or an attempt to mimic. If the account is being used for fraud or a smear campaign against our organization, we should contact the support team of the relevant social media application and request that this account be closed.

### Botnet Detected at Black Market

We receive this alert if any of our organization’s domain or IP addresses is included in the botnet data in the black markets. The user system that became a bot reported in the alert may belong to one of our employees or customers. If the system belongs to a customer, the user’s password should be reset to remediate the incident. If the system belongs to one of our employees forensics investigation should be conducted, the system should be isolated from the network immediately, employee’s network credentials must be reset. Further investigations must be conducted on the system to determine if the system is infected or not.

### Suspicious Content Detected at Deep&Dark Web

Deep&Dark web environments are monitored and all data is collected regularly. We receive this alert if there is anything that mentions our organization in the data after the collected data is interpreted. For example, if there is a post on a hacker forum mentioning an attack against our organization, then we can implement security tightening even before the attack occurs. We can avoid the attack totally or get it over with the least damage thanks to these posts. When we encounter this alert, the post that threatens our organization and its content should be analyzed thoroughly, and necessary actions should be taken accordingly.

### Suspicious Content Detected at IM Platforms

Instant messaging platforms such as Telegram, ICQ, and IRC are the environments that threat actors use for communication. We receive this alert if there is anything that mentions our organization in the data after the conversations of the threat actors in the public or private groups of these platforms are monitored and the collected data is interpreted. In this case, the conversation or the statement about our organization should be analyzed thoroughly and the context of the mention regarding our organization should be determined. If there is a threat to the organization, necessary actions should be taken quickly. 

## Stolen Credit Card Detected

It is a common situation for fraud teams of banks. Threat actors steal credit card information by phishing or other ways and share or sell them in the dark web environment. In these types of cases, banks should follow these stolen credit cards well to protect their customers. We receive this alert if a stolen credit card number matches with one of the bank’s with the help of the intelligence gathered. In this case, we must inform the fraud teams immediately and take action to cancel the card.

## Data Leak Detected on Code Repository

We mentioned that code repositories such as Github, Bitbucket, Azure Blob, and Amazon S3 where we can store data or store codes are one of the sources of intelligence. Sometimes sensitive data for the organization may be forgotten in such environments. We will receive this alert if sensitive and critical data such as an IP address of the organization, domain, database access information, login information that belongs to employees, or if a sensitive report related to the organization is detected in a bucket through the intelligence gathered. In this case, we must take quick action to delete the sensitive data if we manage the relevant repository or bucket. If someone outside of our organization manages it, then, we should go after the takedown option.

## Company Related Information Detected on Malware Analysis Services

Public sandboxes are one of the important intelligence sources for the organization to detect malicious files against our organization. Thousands of samples are uploaded and analyzed in these sandboxes every day. A malicious file referring to our organization is crucial for our organization. It may target our organization directly or may have been uploaded by an attacker with the intention of smearing our organization. In these cases, we receive these alerts as a warning for these malicious files that refer to our organization within the collected data, and we should investigate and analyze the malicious file and take the necessary actions.

## Employee and VIP Credential Detected

These are the warnings that will occur if there is a data leak related to our employees, especially the VIPs that we keep monitoring actively. When we see these alerts, we need to apply the password reset process for the relevant users quickly.

## Cyber Threat Intelligence

CTI is considered a part of XTI, which is the next-generation threat intelligence. It is a sub-branch of XTI, and it is where we can be aware of what is happening in the cyber world in general, where we can learn about current malicious campaigns, the orientation of ransomware groups, or offensive IP addresses around the world. Since it may be difficult to protect our organization with CTI alone, we should support the CTI with our corporate feeds to obtain the most efficient intelligence. We are able to use our SIEM, SOAR, and EDR tools more effectively by integrating them into the CTI feeds and protect our organization better.
